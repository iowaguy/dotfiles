* Installing on a new machine

On a new machine, do the following:
1. Install NixOS on a flashdrive. Replace "sdX" with correct device name
   #+begin_src shell
     dd if=path-to-image of=/dev/sdX
   #+end_src

2. Boot the new machine onto the flashdrive. Booting onto a flashdrive is
   machine specific. Search it.

3. Get my scripts
   #+begin_src shell
     git clone https://github.com/iowaguy/dotfiles
   #+end_src

4. Run my installer script
   #+begin_src shell
     cd home/programs/mynix
     sudo ./mynix fresh
   #+end_src
